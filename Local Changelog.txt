-Resolved URDF misaligned joint issues caused by double generation of URDF from
a fusion file without clearing changes from previous generation.

-Added joint_state_publisher_gui to launch files instead of joint_state_publisher 
due to gui being forked to a separate package, stopping gui from launching 
and causing conflict if both were active.
